Hello ! I'm Victor Adebayo ADESANYA, a Data Scientist and Project Manager with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I'm excited to explore new challenges, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to open-source projects.

Here you'll find some of my work:

#1 Data Science Projects:** (List some of your data science projects here, linking to repositories if available).

#2 Project Management Tools:** (List any project management tools you're proficient in, e.g., Git, Jira, Asana)

I am much more interested in Data, and Projects. Currently, I am still learning and I love it. I hope to collaborate more with individuals with great mindsets in achieving SMART Goals. 

Meet Victor outside Coding Environment:

Outside the coding environment, I love playing a lot, sports (football and video games), reading and conducting scienctific research as Chemist. PLEASE, feel free in reaching out to me. 

Thank you!
